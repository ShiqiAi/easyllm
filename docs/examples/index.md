# Examples

Here are some examples to help you get started with the easyllm library:

## Hugging Face

| Example                                                       | Description                                                                           |

| [Example how to stream chat requests](stream-chat-completion) | Demonstrates streaming multiple chat requests to efficiently chat with the model.     |
| [Example how to stream text requests](stream-text-completion) | Shows how to stream multiple text completion requests.                                |
| [Detailed Completion Example](text-completion-api)            | Uses the TextCompletion API to generate text with the model.                          |
| [Create Embeddings](get-embeddings)                           | Embeds text into vector representations using the model.                              |

The examples cover the main functionality of the library - chat, text completion, and embeddings. Let me know if you would like me to modify or expand the index page in any way.
